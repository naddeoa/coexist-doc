This paper focused on the questions presented in Section~\ref{sec:api}:
\begin{inparaenum}
\item\label{enum:datac} what the data exchange format between clients and the server will be, 
\item\label{enum:syncc} how to synchronize data, and
\item\label{enum:metac} how to tell clients to display the synced data to users. 
\end{inparaenum}
Section~\ref{sec:communication} addressed question~\ref{enum:datac} by modeling a
communication protocol between the server and clients in Coexist.
Section~\ref{sec:replication} addressed question~\ref{enum:syncc} by defining a
method of replicating databases across different instances. This method utilizes
metacolumns like \var{mod\_ts} and \var{deleted} to determine the contents that
need to be pulled down from the server to each of the clients. Finally,
question~\ref{enum:metac} was answered in Section~\ref{sec:metamodel} by
defining a JSON based metamodel that maps database information to user interface
information.
